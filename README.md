🐍 Penta-W Educational Code Examples 

🚀A free, community-driven educational repository providing high-quality code examples, primarily focused on Python, explained using a comprehensive Who, What, Why, Where, How (5W) pedagogical structure.This repository serves as the contribution source for the [Your Educational Website URL Here] website, ensuring all lessons adhere to a consistent, clear, and modern format.

🌟 Project PhilosophyOur goal is to move beyond simple code snippets by requiring context. Every submission must answer the five crucial questions for a full educational experience:Who: Author and target audience.What: The core programming concept.Why: The utility and purpose of the code.Where: The context and application within the Python ecosystem.How: The modern, real-world usage (e.g., in Amazon, NASA, Banks).

📂 Repository StructureAll community-contributed content resides in the dedicated /contributions/ folder, which is divided to separate presentation logic from executable code.FolderPurposeRequired Files/contributions/html/Contains the presentation wrappers for each lesson. These files include the 5W explanations.Must be a copy of template.html or a related .css file./contributions/python/Contains the executable source code for each lesson.Must be a .py file.template.htmlThe required standardized template for all new HTML submissions.DO NOT MODIFY this file directly; always copy it.

📝 How to ContributeWe welcome contributions from anyone with a GitHub account! Contributions are accepted via the standard Fork and Pull Request (PR) workflow.PrerequisitesYou have a GitHub Account.You understand the Fork & Pull Request process.Your code is Python 3.x compatible.Step-by-Step Submission GuideFork the Repository: Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this repository page. This creates a copy of the repo under your own GitHub account.Clone Your Fork: Clone your new fork to your local machine.Bashgit clone [Your Fork URL Here]

Create Your Files: 

Every contribution requires TWO files with the same base name (e.g., data-sort.html and data-sort.py).HTML Presentation (.html):Copy the existing template.html file into the /contributions/html/ folder.Rename the copy (e.g., to my-lesson-title.html).Fill out all five sections (Who, What, Why, Where, How) and paste your formatted Python code into the designated <div class="code-display"> block.You may also submit any related .css files into the html folder.Python Code (.py):Create your Python script with the matching name (e.g., my-lesson-title.py).Place this file in the /contributions/python/ folder.

Commit and Push: Add your new files, commit your changes with a descriptive message, and push them to your fork.

git add .

git commit -m "feat: Added new lesson on Python Decorators"

git push origin main

Open a Pull Request (PR): 

Navigate back to your fork on GitHub and click the "New Pull Request" button. 

Ensure the base repository is this repository, and the head repository is your fork.

🚨 Submission RequirementsAll explanatory content must follow the 5W structure provided in template.html.All files must be placed in their respective folders: .html and .css in /html/, .py in /python/.Do not modify any files outside the /contributions/ directory.
